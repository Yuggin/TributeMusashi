                <h3 class="text-center text-success">Here's a brief review of Musashi's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Exact details of Miyamoto Musashi’s birth is not known but it is said that he was born in 1584 in the Miyamoto village in
                        Harima Province to Shinmen Munisai, a martial artist and master of the sword and jutte.</li>
                    <li>It is speculated that when young Musashi turned seven, he was raised by his uncle Dorinbo, in Shoreian
                        temple. A Buddhist follower himself, Dorindo trained the young lad at Buddhism. He was even taught
                        the basic reading and writing skills
                    </li>

                        the basic reading and writing skills
                    </li>
                    <li>His first ever duel was at the age of thirteen against the samurai Arima Kihei, who fought using the
                        Kashima Shinto-ryu style, founded by Tsukahara Bokuden. He successfully challenged the latter with
                        his excellence at swordsmanship.</li>
                    <li>In 1599, he moved out of his village leaving his family possessions with his sister and brother-in-law.
                        He spent much of his time in engaging himself in duels.</li>
                    <li>The following year, i.e. in 1600, a war incurred between the Toyotomi and the Tokugawa during which he
                        supported and fought from the Toyotomi side against the Tokugawa. Not much is known of what occurred
                        later on as he disappeared from the side.</li>
                    <li>He is next reported to have challenged Yoshioka Seijuro, master of the Yoshioka School for a duel. The
                        latter accepted the duel which was to be held outside Rendaiji in Rakuhoku, in the northern part
                        of Kyoto. He won the duel and received the title of ‘Unrivaled Under Heaven’.</li>
                    <li>From 1605 to 1612, he travelled extensively all over Japan in Musho Shugyo, which was a warrior pilgrimage
                        site. It was during this time that he honed his skills for the duels.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile in 1611, he started practicing zazen at the Myoshinji Temple. It was there that he met Nagaoka
                        Sado, vassal to Lord Hosokawa Tadaoki. Takodi in turn was a powerful lord who had received the fief
                        of northern Kyushu after the Battle of Sekigahara.</li>
                    <li>The following year (1612), he had a duel with Saski Moire, popularly known as ‘The Demon of the Western
                        Provinces’. However, he successfully outstripped the latter as well using a bokkeh that he made from
                        an oar. In this duel as well, he kept his trademark sign of coming in late.</li>
                    <li>He died on June 13, 1645 of thoracic cancer. His body was interred in armor within the village of Yuge,
                        near the main road near Mount Iwato, facing the direction the Hosokawas would travel to Edo</li>
